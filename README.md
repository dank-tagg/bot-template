# Discord Bot template
Are you too lazy to make a start yourself?<br>
Use this repository as a template!

## Usage
This repository exists of two files:
- `main.py`
- `.env`

In `main.py`, it starts the bot with the custom settings specified in `.env`<br>
No commands are added there. You'll need to do that yourself.

### Step-by-step
Download or copy the files. Then, edit the `.env` to your needs. Easy right?
